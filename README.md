# MyReads

A simple app to keep track of books that the user is currently reading, wants to read or has read. The user can search a respository of books from the Search Page, then choose a reading shelf for any book. Any selections will be reflected on the main page, where all three shelves and their respectively books are displayed. 

It is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). The CSS and HTML markup has been provided, along with a backend server. All React functionality has been added. 

### Install

Clone the GitHub repository, then install and launch:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/jenleap/reactnd-myreads
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
