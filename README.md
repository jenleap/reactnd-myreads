# MyReads

A simple app to keep track of books that the user is currently reading, wants to read or has read.

It is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). The CSS and HTML markup has been provided, along with a backend server. All React functionality has been added. 

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
